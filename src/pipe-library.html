          <p>
            ABS is the black plastic pipe that you commonly see inside a home's
            drain-waste-vent system. ABS pipe may appear at the beginning of
            your Sewercam sewer scope if the side sewer was accessed from inside
            (or under) your home.
          </p>
          <p>
            Generally speaking, the inspection camera hardly ever reveals any
            problems within the interior ABS pipe, much like the other pipe
            types generally only found in the interior portion of a home&rsquo;s
            side-sewer line&mdash; <a data-scroll href="#copper">copper</a> and
            <a data-scroll href="#lead">lead</a>.

        <dt id="backflow-valve">Backflow Valve</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            A backflow valve is an inline device designed to prevent anything
            from flowing back up your side sewer. Not common to all side sewers,
            it&rsquo;s usually found in areas where the side sewer is more
            susceptible to pressure from the city main&mdash;usually when a
            house is close to the city main and there isn&rsquo;t a large
            difference in height between the two.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your Sewercam sewer scope may be able to partially inspect the
            backflow valve, but the inspection camera cannot push past the
            backflow valve, as it will become trapped on the far side of the
            valve.

          <p>
            Cast iron pipe is commonly seen in older homes, mostly in the
            interior plumbing (a short stub usually passes through the
            home&rsquo;s foundation into the soil outside of the home). Cast
            iron is solid pipe, but it is susceptible to
            <a href="common-problems.html#corrosion">corrosion</a> over long
            periods of time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Generally speaking, most Sewercam sewer scopes that involve cast
            iron reveal a healthy cast-iron pipe.
          </p>
          <a data-scroll href="#top">Return to Top</a>
        </dd>
        <dt id="cleanout">Cleanout</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            The cleanout&mdash;a screw-on cap that can be removed and
            replaced&mdash;is the preferred means of access to a side-sewer
            line. Most homes have a cleanout installed, but the location can be
            in any number of places. If you&rsquo;re looking for your cleanout,
            check in the following places:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              outside of your home, near the base of your foundation&rsquo;s
              wall
            </li>
            <li>in your basement or crawlspace</li>
            <li>behind your washer and dryer</li>
            <li>in closets</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If your Sewercam sewer scope technician cannot find a cleanout, he
            can usually access the line by removing a toilet, scoping the line,
            and replacing the toilet with a fresh seal. Alternatively, he can
            sometime access the line through a roof vent. Pulling and replacing
            a toilet requires extra labor and cost, so a
            <a href="your-sewer-scope.html#pricing">small charge </a>is applied.

          <p>
            Vitrified clay pipe is a durable, eco-friendly pipe material that
            sometimes gets more bad press than it deserves. Along with concrete
            pipe, it is susceptible to
            <a href="common-problems.html#offset">shifting</a> or
            <a href="common-problems.html#fracture">fracturing</a> if
            surrounding soil moves. Vitrified clay pipe, however, is far more
            durable than concrete and doesn't erode over time like concrete.
          </p>
          <p>
            If trees or shrubs are planted over a clay tile pipe, roots will
            likely find their way in the pipe section&rsquo;s joints.
            <a href="common-problems.html#root-intrusion">Root intrusion</a> is
            a fairly common and easily treatable condition on which your
            Sewercam sewer scope technician can advise you.

          <p>
            Concrete pipe is a fairly common material that was generally used in
            side sewers built before the mid 1980&rsquo;s. It is durable, with a
            lifespan between 70&mdash;90 years. The collective experience of
            Sewercam technicians show that concrete pipe laid in the
            1930&rsquo;s may require replacing in certain sections where the
            <a href="common-problems.html#erosion">erosion</a> is more severe.
            Though not as susceptible as vitrified clay, concrete is somewhat
            subject to <a href="common-problems.html#offset">shifting</a> or
            <a href="common-problems.html#fracture">fracturing</a> if
            surrounding soil moves.

            If trees or shrubs are planted over a concrete pipe, roots will

            <a data-scroll href="#lead">lead</a> pipe), Sewercam&rsquo;s

          <p>
            Orangeburg pipe (bituminous fiber pipe) is basically a pressed-fiber
            pipe impregnated with pitch. You might think of it as cardboard roll
            (like the interior cardboard roll in paper towels) soaked in tar.
            Generally speaking, Orangeburg is problematic because of its
            tendency to
            <a href="common-problems.html#constriction"
              >&ldquo;choke&rdquo; its interior diameter</a
            >
            as the layers of pressed fiber off-gas and bubble up.
          </p>
          <p>
            The presence of Orangeburg pipe doesn&rsquo;t mean that the
            side-sewer line needs to be replaced! Orangeburg pipe just generally
            has a shorter lifespan than other pipe types. Your Sewercam sewer
            scope technician can accurately advise you about the health of your
            Orangeburg pipe.

            PVC (SDR 40) is very durable and long-lasting white poly(vinyl

            SDR (SDR 35) is a very durable and long-lasting poly(vinyl chloride)

            pipe. It&rsquo;s usually fairly easy to identify by its light green
            color. Although it is slightly more susceptible to

            Transite is an asbestos-fiber and cement pipe that is fairly durable

            can sometimes be found in side-sewers laid before 1980. When
            Transite is found, the vast majority of Sewercam sewer scopes have
